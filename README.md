# Binary-Classification-Webapp-Using-Streamlit
In this Machine Learning project I have built a Web app using Streamlit library.
In this Web App, the viewer can visualize performace of various Machine Learning Models on the Mushrooms Dataset. 

How to run this Web App on your pc:
1] Make Sure you have installed pyton 3.6 or greater
2] Install Streamlit library: $pip install streamlit
3] In the app.py file change the address of mushrooms.csv file in pd.read_csv()
